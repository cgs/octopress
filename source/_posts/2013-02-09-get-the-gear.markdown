You're starting a new hobby, but you need some gear. Before you fret
over getting the latest and greatest, condider the following:

Here's a video of irish musician Patsy Hanley totally killing it on a
wooden flute patched up with blue duct tape:

People, stop fucking about trying to find the lightest, strongest,
most professional, best sounding, fastest-booting, thinnest, most
waterproof (but also breathable!) whatever-it-is you can, and instead focus on creating and doing. You'll
figure out what tools will work the best after you've gained some
experience.  Some simple rules of thumb:

- Don't buy a piece of junk
- Buy the best you can afford
- Spend more or less based on your interest level

Once the appropriate whatever-it-is has been aquired, starting using
it to make things / do things instead of dicking around on
internet forums and review sites. And please don't be these guys:
