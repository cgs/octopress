> Sorry I forgot your name, I'm, ya know, like really bad with names!

Nearly everyone makes this excuse. Frankly, it's bullshit. It's not
that you're bad with names, it's that you were thinking about what you
were going to have for dinner later instead of paying attention when
you were introduced to someone new.

It takes effort to remember someone's name. Repeat it to
yourself a few times. Remember couples' names in pairs. Associate an
image or phrase with the person's name. Ask for their last name;
sometimes it's easier to remember the whole thing.

Either remember the name, or admit you were being a shitty
listener. You are not "bad with names."
