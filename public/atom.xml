    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;re starting a new hobby, but you need some gear. Before you fret
over getting the latest and greatest, condider the following:</p>

<p>Professional photographer Dean Holland <a href="http://connect.dpreview.com/post/2863436371/leaving-my-dslr-at-home-iphone-experiment">uses his iphone camera to take incredible photos.</a></p>

<p>Climber John &#8220;Verm&#8221; Sherman climbs an extremely difficult route (5.13)

<p>Here&#8217;s a video of irish musician Patsy Hanley totally killing it on a
wooden flute patched up with blue duct tape:</p>

<p>People, stop fucking about trying to find the lightest, strongest,
most professional, best sounding, fastest-booting, thinnest, most
waterproof (but also breathable!) whatever-it-is you can, and instead focus on creating and doing. You&#8217;ll
figure out what tools will work the best after you&#8217;ve gained some
experience.  Some simple rules of thumb:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t buy a piece of junk</li>
<li>Buy the best you can afford</li>
<li>Spend more or less based on your interest level</li>
</ul>


<p>Once the appropriate whatever-it-is has been aquired, starting using
it to make things / do things instead of dicking around on
internet forums and review sites. And please don&#8217;t be these guys:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Sorry I forgot your name, I&#8217;m, ya know, like really bad with names!</p></blockquote>

<p>Nearly everyone makes this excuse. Frankly, it&#8217;s bullshit. It&#8217;s not
that you&#8217;re bad with names, it&#8217;s that you were thinking about what you
were going to have for dinner later instead of paying attention when
you were introduced to someone new.</p>

<p>It takes effort to remember someone&#8217;s name. Repeat it to
yourself a few times. Remember couples&#8217; names in pairs. Associate an
image or phrase with the person&#8217;s name. Ask for their last name;
sometimes it&#8217;s easier to remember the whole thing.</p>

<p>Either remember the name, or admit you were being a shitty
listener. You are not &#8220;bad with names.&#8221;</p>
