<p>Nearly everyone makes this excuse. Frankly, it&#8217;s bullshit. It&#8217;s not
that you&#8217;re bad with names, it&#8217;s that you were thinking about what you
were going to have for dinner later instead of paying attention when
you were introduced to someone new.</p>

<p>It takes effort to remember someone&#8217;s name. Repeat it to
yourself a few times. Remember couples&#8217; names in pairs. Associate an
image or phrase with the person&#8217;s name. Ask for their last name;
sometimes it&#8217;s easier to remember the whole thing.</p>

<p>Either remember the name, or admit you were being a shitty
listener. You are not &#8220;bad with names.&#8221;</p>
